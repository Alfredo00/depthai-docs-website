All DepthAI editions utilize the System on Module (SoM), which can also be used by itself to integrate into your own designs. The SoM allows the board that carries it to be a simple, easy four-layer standard-density board, as opposed to the high-density-integration (HDI) stackup (with laser-vias and stacked vias) required to directly integrate the VPU itself.
