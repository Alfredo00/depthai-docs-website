Use megaAI on your existing host. Since the AI/vision processing is done on the Myriad X, a typical desktop could handle tens of megaAIs plugged in (the effective limit is how many USB ports the host can handle).

And since megaAI can encode 1080p and 4K video (see [here](https://docs.luxonis.com/faq/#how-do-i-record-video-with-depthai)), you can now even save 4K video on a Pi Zero!  

## Requirements

* USB-Capable Host Running an Operation System capable of running OpenCV
  * Ubuntu 18.04 or Raspbian 10 (pre-built Python library)
  * Other operating systems, see [here](https://docs.luxonis.com/api/)
* USB3C cable
* USB2 or USB3 port on the host
* [A supported Python version](/api/#python_version) on the host

## What's in the box?

* {{page.title}} Carrier Board
* USB3C cable (3 ft.)

## Setup

Follow the steps below to setup your DepthAI device.

<h3 class="step js-toc-ignore"><span></span> Connect your host to the DepthAI USB carrier board</h3>

<h3 class="step js-toc-ignore"><span></span> Connect the DepthAI USB power supply (included)</h3>

<h3 class="step js-toc-ignore"><span></span> Install the Python DepthAI API</h3>

[See our instructions](/api#install).

<h3 class="step js-toc-ignore"><span></span> Calibrate Stereo Cameras</h3>

Use the DepthAI [calibration script](/products/stereo_camera_pair/#calibration) with the following argument:

```
-co '{"board_config": {"left_to_right_distance_cm": 7.5}}'
```

This sets the distance between the stereo cameras to their distance on the board.

<h3 class="step js-toc-ignore"><span></span> Download and run DepthAI Python examples</h3>
