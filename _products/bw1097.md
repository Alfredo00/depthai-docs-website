## Setup

To get started:

1. Connect to an external display via the HDMI port.
2. Connect a keyboard and mouse via the USB port.
3. Connect the included power supply.
4. After the Pi boots, [upgrade your DepthAI API to the latest](/api#api_upgrade).

On boot, the Pi will run [a Python test script](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-python-extras/blob/master/test.py) that displays a video stream annotated with object localization metadata:

In the screenshot above, DepthAI identified a tv monitor (1.286 m from the camera) and a chair (3.711 m from the camera). See [the list of object labels](https://github.com/luxonis/depthai-python-extras/blob/master/resources/nn/object_detection_4shave/labels_for_mobilenet_ssd.txt) on GitHub.


### Internet Connectivity

An Internet connection isn't required to run the demo script. However, you'll want to connect the Pi to a WiFI network to begin trying the DepthAI tutorials and examples.

#### Connecting to a WiFi network

An embedded WiFi module is not included on the board. To connect to a WiFi network, use a Linux-compatible USB WiFi dongle. The Pi should recognize the dongle and display available WiFi networks in the upper right corner of the Raspbian Desktop UI.

#### Connecting to a network via Ethernet

The board includes an Ethernet port. Connecting an Ethernet cable to the port will enable Internet access.
