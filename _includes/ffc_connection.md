The FFC (flexible flat cable) Connectors on the BW1098FFC require care when handling.  Once inserted and latched, the connectors are robust, but they are easily susceptible to damage during the de-latching process when handling the connectors, particularly if to much force is applied during this process.

The video below shows a technique without any tool use to safely latch and delatch these connectors.

Once the flexible flat cables are securely latched, you should see something like this:
