    Once the installation is complete you need to disable the **App Execution Aliases** for
    both **python.exe** and **python3.exe**.

    This can be done by going to start and typing :code:`Manage app` and choose the :code:`Manage app execution aliases` entry.

    From there you turn off the :code:`App Installer` alias for both **python.exe** and **python3.exe**.
