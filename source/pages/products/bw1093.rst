Use OAK-1/megaAI on your existing host. Since the AI/vision processing is done on the Myriad X, a typical desktop could handle
tens of OAK-1/megaAI plugged in (the effective limit is how many USB ports the host can handle).

And since it can encode 1080p and 4K video (see :ref:`here <How do I Record (or Encode) Video with DepthAI?>`) you can now even save 4K video on a Pi Zero!

- USB3C cable
